Are they really liberalizing trade? Is it overstated in the piece? Is it all rhetoric? Is liberalizing trade even necessarily a good thing despite them saying it is in the piece? These are questions that I could still accept as unresolved after reading that piece, in that I am not necessarily accepting anything as fact.  / But how exactly is that different than media in the US that repeat government officials talking points line for line and produce it as news. I could apply my filter for reading this piece to virtually any media coverage I see in the US. Will this politician really do this thing or is it all talk? Will it really be as far reaching as they say? Is it really even a good thing for it to happen? The average American when they are of the political party of an administration and a major publication publishes an administration's quotes line for line about a new policy accepts it all as facts rather than asking those same questions I applied to the Chinese propaganda.
